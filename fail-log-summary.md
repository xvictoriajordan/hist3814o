# Fail Log Summary
A summary of my fail logs organized by week, updated as I learn

## Week 1
This week was interesting, I learnt a lot about programs mostly and how they can contribute to history. In terms of fail logs, I did not really fail at much. Everything I signed up for worked on the first try, I had issues with the VPN and overall had a pretty good week. This made me feel fairly accomplished since I do not see myself as the most techy person, but I guess I am enough to have gotten through this week successfully. I am looking forward to the challenges that will present themselves in next week's course!

# Week 4 Fail Log

* On exercise 1 and typed in `grep '\bto\b' texas.txt` and I cannot seem to get the word to to be highlighted in red like in the video. 
* My issue seems to be the fact that it is stuck in the root mode. It is not acting the same as usual. I tried making another account and it seems to be working better and doing what is in the videos.
* Just logged back into the original account and now it seems to be working. Really weird, but things are working!
* Before doing the `sed -r -i.bak 's/(.+\bto\b.+)/~\1/g' texas.txt` in Command Line, I tried practicing on RegExr but could only seem to get the command to highlight the word to but not to replace anything. I ended up giving up in RegExr and just did it in Command Line and it worked. Would have maybe been helpful if the video underneath the instructions showed how to do it.
* When I got to step 6 I realized that my whole file had one too many commas in each line. I went back to step three and realized that I forgot to put in a space between `( [0-9]{4})`. Re-doing this step solved my problem!
* When uploading my cleaned up correspondence onto OpenRefine it did not go into the three columns right away. I saw that someone else had this issue and followed the instructions saying that when you go to upload it you have to select columns sperated by commas.
* Exploring Voyant Tools was a lot of fun. Not only was looking at the "home page" cool with all of the visualizations but also exploring the other tools to examine the text. This is a site I see myself possibly using in the future, if not for school at least for myself. When looking at the correspondence and seeing how some of the top words were names, it made me think about how you can look up the most popular baby names every year and how this tool (while not sure if they used this exact one) could be useful to find those names.

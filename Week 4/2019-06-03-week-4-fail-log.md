# Week 4 Fail Log

* On exercise 1 and typed in `grep '\bto\b' texas.txt` and I cannot seem to get the word to to be highlighted in red like in the video. 
* My issue seems to be the fact that it is stuck in the root mode. It is not acting the same as usual. I tried making another account and it seems to be working better and doing what is in the videos.
* Just logged back into the original account and now it seems to be working. Really weird, but things are working!

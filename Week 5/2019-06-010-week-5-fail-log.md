# Fail Log

* Started with exercise 2 (topic modeling) and it is really cool. While the war diaries are not cleaned up enough to present any meaningful data. I think that if they were cleaned up it could present some really cool findings. The tables are also layed out nicely and makes it easy to see which documents have that topic.
* Did exercise 6 since I already know that I like Voyant tools. Adding the stop words made the data all that more interesting since it skims the words. Again, doing this with clean data makes it all the more interesting when going through all the different types of visualization.
* On exercise 4 it says that you make certain words important or unimportant in the preview stage but this does not seem to be an option right now.
* The word cloud in exercise 4 is a little different than in exercise 6, this is mainly because you do not have the option to remove stop words, but you can do so manually based on your idea of stop words.
* Nevermind, I found a way to remove stopwords, and Overview may even go a step further by removing words that are soley numbers and removes the 50,000 most common words in Google books. It is interesting to now see that there are different most popular words compared to what we saw in Voyanttools. Overview in this case seems to give a list that is more narrowed down and percise. This is probably because Overview recognizes the titles in the cvs file and therefore does not count them as actual words in the articles
* When doing exercise 3 I read the part about creating a new project, but I thought a new R script pane had opened once I created the new project so when I pasted `install.packages("mallet") library("mallet") install.packages("RCurl") library("RCurl")` nothing happened. After trying a couple of times, I watched the video and realized that that a new R scropt pane had not actually opened up.
* Also on exercise 3 I forgot that you have to run each line and that simply clicking run will not do each line, this is why nothing was intalling.
* More for exercise 3, Rcurl did not want to install on RStudio, so I went to go follow the instructions to `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev` in Command Line but my Command Line wasn't working. It just gave me a blank black screen with no prompt. I will try and refresh and see what happens! (After refresh I could log in and there was no more blank page!)
* `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev` didn't work right away, but I remembered having a similar issue in the past and needing to do an update (`sudo apt-get update`) this allowed Rcurl to instal in Command Line
* I could not get my Rstudio to show the side windows like the in the video (like the environment and history tab). I tried logging in and out, closing and opening tabs but nothing seems to be working.

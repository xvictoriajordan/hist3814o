# Fail Log

* Started with exercise 2 (topic modeling) and it is really cool. While the war diaries are not cleaned up enough to present any meaningful data. I think that if they were cleaned up it could present some really cool findings. The tables are also layed out nicely and makes it easy to see which documents have that topic.
* Did exercise 6 since I already know that I like Voyant tools. Adding the stop words made the data all that more interesting since it skims the words. Again, doing this with clean data makes it all the more interesting when going through all the different types of visualization.
* On exercise 4 it says that you make certain words important or unimportant in the preview stage but this does not seem to be an option right now.
* The word cloud in exercise 4 is a little different than in exercise 6, this is mainly because you do not have the option to remove stop words, but you can do so manually based on your idea of stop words.
* Nevermind, I found a way to remove stopwords, and Overview may even go a step further by removing words that are soley numbers and removes the 50,000 most common words in Google books. It is interesting to now see that there are different most popular words compared to what we saw in Voyanttools. Overview in this case seems to give a list that is more narrowed down and percise.

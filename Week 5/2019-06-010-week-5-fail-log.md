# Fail Log

* Started with exercise 2 (topic modeling) and it is really cool. While the war diaries are not cleaned up enough to present any meaningful data. I think that if they were cleaned up it could present some really cool findings. The tables are also layed out nicely and makes it easy to see which documents have that topic.

# Week 3 Fail Log

* Couldn't figure out how to get my file from exercise 1 from my DH Box to GitHub using command line (I'll have to review it but as of right now it wasn't happening) so I just downloaded it and uploaded it as a new file.
* After downloading all the file for Ian Milligan's exercise, my browser froze, and then restarted. I did not get a chance to save my history for that part.
I decided to delete the files for that exercise so I could redo it and save my steps. DHBox wouldn't let me delete the whole file, a few folders remained. So I left them and re-did the exercise.
* Trying to complete exercise 3, so far I've had no luck on it being able to open correctly in Firefox. I am still trying to go through and make sure all my code is correct.
* After starting fresh and re-doing all the code (I was getting too mixed up and decided a fresh start would be better) I finally did it! [This annotation](https://hyp.is/RBLjsmEnEeipk4f1oHw-Gw/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-2/Exercises/) describes this moment very well!
* Skipped on exercise 5 as I did not want to sign up for a twitter account. I did read through the exercise and it seems really interesting what you can do with the information gathered.
* On exercise 6, and the install for ImageMagick is not working. I have tried what others have suggested in the chat but nothing so far. I think I will log out then back into DHBox and see if it works.
* Asked the group if they knew how to fix my issue above and it turns out for the `apt-get update` I had to put `sudo` in front of it. Everything downlaoded smooth from there.
* Exercise 6 was interesting, comparing the two documents (texts from the image), both had some pros and cons. It was just really cool to see the text being somewhat written out!
* Couldn't get the batch conversions to work. Then saw the note that trying `~war-diary` might work. That didn't work. Then saw another note saying that it's actually `~/war-diary`. The downlaod worked from there.
* Also thought it only downloaded 2 files at first. I then realized that it takes time for this to work and that by going between my File Manager home and the war diary file, I could see them update every minute or so. Just waiting for all of them to download now.

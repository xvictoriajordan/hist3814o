# Exercise 1: The Dream Case

### Epigraphic Database Heidelberg

* Performed a search on the first database of the word figlina. I didn't select a specfic country, but I did select the Late Antiquity historic period (284-476AD). This search gave 3 results, 2 in present day Bulgaria and one in present day Austria. While the records seem to state that it is some time of stone or tile that has writting on it, in all three cases there are no pictures assciated with the searches. 

[Link](https://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/inschrift/HD027241) for the search with the three results.

### Commwealth War Graves Commission, Find War Dead

* For this database search I actually knew what I was looking for. I know my Jordan family's military history very well thanks to a cousin of mine who has done most of the research and put it into a book. For my search I looked up the name Leslie George Jordan as he is one of the few relatives I have that died during the war. I also knew that he served with the Royal Air Force. Jordan is a really common English last name, so while my ancestor did pop up as the first result, there was around 2 pages of names that the database thought were similar. His name is commemorated on a plaque in Sussex.

I will save this data on my GitHub under week 3.

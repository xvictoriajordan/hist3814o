# Week 2 Fail Log

* Forgot to put .md at the end of my Dillinger document and then spent 20 minutes trying to figure out why it wasn't formatting correctly. *Note to self, don't forget .md!* 
* When imbedding an image into Dillinger I couldn't get the image to appear at first when I pasted the web address from the address bar. I then right clicked and clicked on copy image address and it worked!
* While looking for websites to link to my Dillinger post I found [this open access page](https://library.carleton.ca/services/open-access) on Carleton's Library front page. I will be looking into it futher and I'm not sure if it's new but I've never seen it before.
* Typed in my DHbox password wrong a bunch of times while trying to download Pandoc so I restarted the proccess twice thinking I was doing something wrong.
* When trying to complete step 12 of exercise 2, after typing in pandoc -o todayscommands.docx dhbox-work-today.md and then 1s to make sure that the file had converted it kept saying "command not found" and when I clicked on the file manager the file was not there. I quickly watched the video to see that you have to hit the home button in the file manager to refresh it.
* I also just realized that the commmand is not 1s (number 1+s) but ls (letter l+s) which is why it was saying command not found. The front in the textbook makes it look like a 1 and not a l (`1` vs `l`)
* Moving onto exercise 4 I wasn't sure how to open the file I had already created as I thought `nano filename.md` was only to create and not open. Turns out it does both!
Had a little trouble with step 4.3. I created a new document in my branch but it wouldn't let me do `git add -A` it kept saying it was unknown. I didn't want to exit out because I basically had no idea where I was or how to get back, so I just kept typing `git add -A` in both lower letter a and capital A until it decided to work. Odd.

### Week 2: Open Access Research 

**Readings**

This week's readings were interesting, especially the ones about open notebooks as this was the topic that I generally knew less about. Open data on the other hand is something that I have dealt with quite a bit in my political science classes. Starting with the mandatory quantitative research method course where we dealt with census and population data. I have also had many classes where readings were products of ATIP requests and I even had a course where an expert came in and told us about ATIP and how we can use it. In terms of history courses on the other hand I have used open data much less as I find up to date most of my history professors stick to scholarly articles for both readings and in the requirements for writing final essays. This week's readings and last weeks as well has made me realize that open data is something that can be useful to history courses.

The idea of open access research is interesting. It presents an exciting but also scary way to share and collaborate. As stated in the McDaniel reading, having open notebooks allow for errors to be spotted, for collaboration and for links and opinions to be explored before publication. This to me is exciting and can be seen as an opportunity to further enrich research and allows the for others to add to the research which could benefit the author and others who are reading the notebook. I believe that the sharing of ideas can only benefit and create stronger research. To tie this into my major, Pierre Trudeau operated his cabinet in this sort of "open notebook" method. While he did have cabinet ministers who were in charge of certain portfolios, he treated cabinet meetings like discussion groups where ministers could share their opinions about policy. He believed that this could improve policy recommendations and also allow for collaboration between departments (which he actively encouraged). I think that the Fitzpatrick reading really highlights the advantages of using open access research and the sharing of ideas in general. I agree with her that universities need to focus on listening and engaging with what is in front of us. 

But I also agree with a lot of the annotations in the readings that this idea of open access research does have its limits and downfalls. There is this general fear of work being stolen or changed without the original authors consent, the thought of ideas being stolen and what open access means for authors that want to get published. I think that McDaniel highlights a solution with the idea of not sharing the entire notebook and letting readers know that. It would really depend on the author and what they are comfortable on sharing.

As a student, I think the idea also has positives and negatives. I like Owens idea of having linked footnotes, I really think that would be helpful. As a student or anyone doing research, looking at what sources the original author uses helps find other sources to use. But I have found that a lot of the time the sources in the footnotes are not available to me through the library or Google Scholar which is disappointing. While I have seen some articles linking what they use in the footnotes it is not yet an industry standard. One of my concerns as a student on the other hand (highlighted in [this annotation](https://hyp.is/upH_XnfoEemJP6f0pIv6aQ/wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)) is to what extent as a student can I use open access research? Many professors require students to use scholarly research that is peer reviewed. So while I think that initiative is good and interesting, I'm not so sure how I could actively use it in an essay for an example. 

**Exercises**

This week was way more challenging compared to last. While I had little trouble with exercise 1, exercise 2 was much more difficult. I'm not even really sure what I did. I had a couple of mishaps which I recorded in my fail log. I would not say that I was frustrated as restarting things from the top generally solved my problems, I just found it difficult as I had no idea what I was really doing (in terms of what these commands were and why). I did get the point of the last part (converting the documents) but other than that not too sure. I guess like last week I will maybe understand better once I practice more.

I did manage to complete all of the exercise this week. I'm still a little confused about things, but I think that being able to refer back to the instructions in this week will be helpful. I did sort of regret taking a break between exercises, I next week I will try and complete them all in one sitting as I feel it will be easier for me to understand what I'm doing. 

As for my fail log as a whole, most of what is in there is me just explaining how I mixed things up or my thought process for errors that I made. Most of them were pretty silly like putting in wrong passwords and forgetting to .md at the end of things.

Interestingly enough, while working on the dillinger.io portion of class I found that [Carleton](https://library.carleton.ca/services/open-access) has a webpage for open access work. A lot of my concerns with this week's readings had to do with if professor's would accept open access data. Finding this web page I think highlights the fact that open data is becoming more of a "norm".

Annotations
======

**First Annotation**

[My first annotation](https://hyp.is/upH_XnfoEemJP6f0pIv6aQ/wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) as mentioned above, had to do with the use of open data for student research. The McDaniel article highlights the fact that open data notebooks could be very useful as they would be allow for content to be shared quickly versus waiting for an article to be peer reviewed. While I think the idea is great and could really benefit those doing similar research, I question how useful it is for students. I should have clarified that I meant undergrad students who for the most part are not doing independent research projects or writing thesis' therefore many professors require scholarly, peer reviewed work when writing essays. This would not exactly be useful for these students, and honestly if it was not taking this course, I would have probably never really looked into this type of data.


**Second Annotation**

[My second annotation](https://hyp.is/DRZTMnfvEem6NR8Ewjy2HQ/kfitz.info/generous-thinking-introduction/) was in regards to the Kathleen Fitzpatrick article, specifically around her comments about how people who pursue art history degrees are often put down or told that their degree is less important compared to pre-professional degrees. While I am not in a humanities degree, I find similar sentiments about being in a social science degree (Poli Sci). People often ask what can you do with that degree or assume that you can only become a politician but many do not know that you can do much more. As I mentioned in my annotation, Carleton has a great master's programs that lets those interested in political science explore the other avenues associated with politics. This includes, communications, writing, campaigning and management. So while some think that certain degrees are limiting, I think otherwise.


**Third Annotation**

[My third annotation](https://hyp.is/u_u-fngCEemWM09qFrlDRA/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/) was just a little helpful tip that user jennatarasco_ found helpful. The notebook mentioned that copy and pasting often carries the formatting along with it. I left a note saying that if use ctrl+shift+V it will paste your work without the formatting from where you copied it. I actually learnt this when looking for tech tips for the weekly newsletter my office puts out!

## Comments/Concerns

Just a couple of things that have bugged me this week but are really out of my control. for one, I hate that when using GitHub my spell check does not automatically work (like misspelt words are not highlighted) I will admit that I am a fast typer, and I am not super gifted in the spelling department so it kind of annoying to have to copy paste my work into a word doc to double check my spelling before committing (generally when I type longer paragraphs). 

The other thing is that I did most of my work on Thursday and at that point, no one had made any annotations that I could reply to. Therefore I had to check back every day to see if someone had written something so that I could reply as it is part of the class. In other online classes the professors normally ask for students to make one comment by a certain day so that it is fair for everyone to be able to reply and not have to wait until more people start their work.

# Week 1 fail log
So far this week has been interesting. I have not faced many issues thus far, I made all my accounts, signed into the VPN and seem to understand how GitHub works. I am more confused about what the actual work is for week 1, that being said I haven't even gone through the whole unit yet. As for annotations right now, I haven't done any other than the required ones. Hoping to update these once I start the readings.

## First Annotation
[My first annotation](https://hyp.is/LeGxsnLFEemQ-HuaI8j9Mg/www.themacroscope.org/?page_id=599) was on the first reading in the section *Putting Big Data to Good Use: Historical Case Study* where it was talking about the *Old Bailey* and how now that it has been digitally transcribed allowing for all kinds of research to be done within it. I thought this was particularly interesting because often when reading scholarly research we are presented with all kinds of data and facts but I find often I have little or no idea how this data was found. This project focused on language which is something I had touched upon before and did not even think about how historians gathered this information. This annotation really put into prespective the connections between tech and history.

## Second Annotation
[My second annotation](https://hyp.is/pjVBAnUhEemQzitK3KOeRg/cradledincaricature.com/2017/06/06/the-hard-digital-history-that-underpins-my-book/) relates back to the first one about how tech and other fields of study can relate and contribute to an area where it might not be seen as common. This reading and the other one from Baker in general futhered my understanding about how this topic and class in general work in the real world and why it is important.

## Third Annotation
[My third annotation](https://hyp.is/4lOwOnUkEemLDrcQIrfnnA/historyonics.blogspot.com/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html) was a question that at this point in time has yet to be answered. The author Tim Hitchcock uses this term "distant reading". I'm really not sure what this terms means and Google has not been overly helpful either. From my understanding it is reading information/data about a group of texts, in the sense that you are not reading the texts themselves but data that has been produced from them? But I'm really not sure if that's correct.

## Comments/Concerns
My only really concern at this point is realted to language. Based on the readings there were quite a few terms that I did not know and felt like a little powerpoint or video introduction to this class and topic would have been helpful. I am a visual learner in general (one of the main reasons why I take online classes) and I think that a more personal and visual introduction would have really helped me grasp what exactly is going on.
